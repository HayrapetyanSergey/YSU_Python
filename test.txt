The program reads the file given by the user's  and executes it using python programming language.
It understands the syntax I've created, and it performs actions on it. If you want to announce
variable, it is necessary to use the keyword "var" at the beginning of the line, and then give the name of the variable,
which must be any ascii letter, the variable name must be followed by a ":=" sign so that the interpreter will understand 
and assign the value that is assigned to the variable by the user.
1.  If the variable name is not any ascii letter, the program will return the corresponding error information.
    SyntaxError("Variables must start with ascii letter.")

2.  If an undeclared variable is used, you will receive an error message.
    NameError(f"Name ___ is unrecognizable.")

The end of an "if", "while" or "for" condition and loops must have a "!" symbol to let the program understand that 
the specified condition or loops have completed.
3.  If the "!" sign is missing, the program will give information about the corresponding error.
    SyntaxError("Number of 'if, while,for' and '!' must be equal:")
    SyntaxError("After while you mast end with !")
    SyntaxError("After for you mast end with !")
    SyntaxError("After if you mast end with !")

"If" condition will work if the given condition is true, otherwise it will just skip the body of that condition.

"While" loop will work as long as given condition is true.If the given condition is always true, then it will be 
fulfilled endlessly.

When using a "for" loop, you need to declare a variable after for, and then specify its modification range with
the help of "from" and "to" words.
    I have worked with for only with numbers, that is, it will work only if a range is given, and then it requests 
    to print the numbers of that range.

The program performs the Print action if the word "print" is found in the line, followed by "[ ]", symbols,
in which the expected output is written.
4.  If it is not followed by a "[ ] " symbol, you will receive a corresponding error message.
    SyntaxError("After print you must start with '[' and finish with']'")

Most importantly, in order for the interpreter to be able to read the file provided by the user, 
it must end with ".hay" extension.
5.  If the extension is different you will get the corresponding error message.
    FileNotFoundError("File must have .hay extension")

Examples
1.
    Input:  var x := 12
            var y := x + 5
            print[y]

    Output: 17

2
    Input:  var x := 12
            var s := "This is so wonderful"

            if x < 23
                print[s]
            !

    Output: This is so wonderful

3. 
    Input:  for var k from 1 to 3
                print[k]
            !

    Output: 1 
            2

4.
    Input:  var y = 2

            while y < 5
                print["example" y]
                var y = y + 1
            !

    Output: "example" 2
            "example" 3
            "example" 4
